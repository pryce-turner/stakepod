Motivation:

easy setup / disaster recovery
easy maintenance (imagePullPolicy: Always)
easy distribution
easy configuration

todo:

monitoring
ansible? may be overkill
split config to avoid shared PID in lighthouse

prep external volumes (optional)
what to do beforehand eg security (link to coincashew security guide)
podman advantages (daemonless, rootless)
how to import keys
systemd process for startup
